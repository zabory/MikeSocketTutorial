	 * There are some things to think about here
	 * Any class that has an incoming connect, can also extend the thread class and handle it itself
	 * 
	 * What should the server process over the client? 
	 * The server should handle anything that can make a difference in the game, positions, bullets, etc
	 * The client should handle anything that does make a difference in the game, particle, rotations, etc
	 * 
	 * Ever so often, the server and client can sync these non important aspects with special commands at their leisure
	 * 
	 * Lets talk multiplayer vs singleplayer processing
